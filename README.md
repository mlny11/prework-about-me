# Increaseing-AccesabilityHmk-1-24-2021
The first homework assigned about reducing the div tags in html
I added a Nav tag to show the navigation links at the top
I added some sections tags to define the diffrent areas of the web page
i added some article tags to further identify the smaller areas in the webpage that were under the sections.
I also added some aside tags to show the floated section on the right.
I also added a footer and header tags in there respective places.
